A website built to help Long Beach Anarchist Collective publicize their events, complete with updateable event listing through Forestry CMS and a service worker leveraged from Gatsby's rich plugin ecosystem to tick that Lighthouse PWA box and enable installation on mobile devices as a web app.

Built on the JAMStack. Migrated from Jekyll, to Hugo, and most recently using Gatsby and React.
